Coding Guidelines

These coding guidelines are used for all files of the HomePageHelper.  These coding guidelines are based on the PEAR ones: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php  In some aspects the HomePageHelper coding guidelines are more precise or differ slightly.  The PEAR coding guidelines were chosen as a base because they are the de facto standard for php code.  Therefore, many php programmers are familiar with them.
In this guidelines, only the differences and addtions to the PEAR coding guidelines are pointed out.


switch
In switches a code block starts with case and generally ends with break.  Therefore, the case and break key words build up a union:
switch (condition) {
	case 'foo':
		...
	break;
	
	case 'bar':
		...
	break;
}


Indenting and Line Length                                                                           
No Line is longer than 100 characters.
For Indenting in the front of lines, tabs are used.  For indenting in the middle of a line, spaces are used.
	example:
	foreach ($foo as $bar) {
		if ($bar == 'foo') {
			$block        = 'related';
			$assignments  = 'contain';
			$spaces       = '.';
			// there are always two spaces after the longest element
		}
	}
For block assignments, the values are indented with spaces.  The value block begins two spaces after the longest element of the left side.


Strings
All strings use ' as delimeter.  There are a few exception:
- database queries
- strings that use \n or \t


Classes
Classes are structured the following way:
- variables in alphabetical order
- functions in alphabetical order

All files contain a file header using the following as a base:
<?php
/**
 * description of the file
 * 
 * @package    HomePageHelper
 * @category   Core
 * @author     Michael Müller-Brockhausen <michael@brockhausen.name>
 * @copyright  2006, Michael Müller-Brockhausen
 * @link       http://homepagehelper.berlios.de
 * @license    http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php GNU Public License
 * @version    1.0
 * @since      1.0
 */

Classes use the following as a base for a phpdoc comment:
/**
